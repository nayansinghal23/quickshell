Quicksell Machine Coding Round - Kanban Board Application

Question -> https://quicksell.notion.site/Frontend-assignment-fa2f7f8aaada4099916994bad6ec70c2

CheckLists ->
1) Created react app using CRA templates.

2) Created Navbar.

3) On clicking down arrow, dropdown list opens.

4) All assests are in svg, in order to reduce the load time of app.

5) CSS written is mobile-first responsive.

6) Created MainContent component where I fetched data from API using fetch() [Axios is also an option].

7) Stored that data in states, filtered all the data corresponding to status of work in an object of array.

8) Since, that object of array has redundancies, so a helper function was written to remove all duplicates.

9) Status Component was created that displays data according to the status of the work.

10) Status Component has a VerticleCard Component which will be used again and again in this project, so I decided to make it as a separate component and pass props to it.

12) Further, VertileCard Component also has a repeated Card Component.
